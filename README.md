# LSTM-Based-ECG-classification
An end-to-end ECG classification project using deep learning and signal processing. The system extracts meaningful features from ECG signals and uses an LSTM model to identify different cardiac rhythms. A Streamlit-based interface allows real-time ECG file upload and prediction.
